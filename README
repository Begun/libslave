ABOUT
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a library that allows any arbitrary C++ application to connect
to a Mysql replication master and read/parse the replication binary
logs.

In effect, any application can now act like a Mysql replication slave,
without having to compile or link with any Mysql server code.

One important use-case for this library is for receiving changes in
the master database in real-time, without having the store the
master's data on the client server.


USAGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Build requirements:

For building the library, you will need:

 * g++

 * The standard mysql C client libraries. (libmysqlclient)

 * The headers of the boost libraries. (http://www.boost.org)
   At the minimum, you will need at least the shared_ptr.hpp, function.hpp,
   any.hpp and bind.hpp. If boost_unit_test_framework and boost_thread will
   be found, tests will be built.

 * You (likely) will need to review and edit the contents of Logging.h
   and SlaveStats.h
   These headers contain the compile-time configuration of the logging
   and monitoring subsystems.
   The provided defaults are sub-standard and an example only.

Usage requirements:

 * Requires Mysql 5.1.23 or above. Tested only with some of the 5.1 and 5.5
   versions of mysql servers.

Compiling:

Create directory "build" in source tree, step into it and run "cmake ..".
Then, if configure is complete, run "make".

Review and edit Logging.h and SlaveStats.h to interface the library to
your app's logging and monitoring subsystems.

You can type "make test" inside of "build" directory to run tests. You
will need a working mysql server for it. Settings of mysql connection
can be adjusted in test/data/mysql.conf. Type "ctest -V" if something
went wrong and you need see test output.

Using the library:

Please see the examples in 'test/'.
